I'm a Datastream.

A data stream is a bi-directional communications channel that allows for the exchange of data between the platform and authorized devices, applications, and services. Each data stream represents a specific attribute, unit or type of information (a variable). Some data stream may be defined automatically by the product template at the time of feed creation. The data stream associated with a feed can be added and deleted after a device is created. When data is written to an unspecified data stream using the IoT API, the data stream will be created dynamically.
